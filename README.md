RiotAccess
==========

RiotAccess is a website designed to simplify the Riot Games API. This is done through a sleek and simple designed single paged application which allows users with no programming experience to retrieve data.

RiotAccess makes use of the Javascript Library Skrollr in order to direct the client along the page.

Initially created with the MEAN stack, shortly abondened after realizing that I had no longer had a need for using my own STACK and went for a single page app instead.
